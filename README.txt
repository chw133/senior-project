This section of the project is all Hardware Schematics, Source Code, and Design.
Here, you will find the PCB design that is the blueprint for our water bottle project.
This will also contain sensor, LED, and bluetooth test code for our Atmega328 microchip
to see if they are working and providing accurate results.
